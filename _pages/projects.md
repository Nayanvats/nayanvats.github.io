##### machine learning   
* __Supervised Learning__ [[Code]](https://github.com/Nayanvats/) 
    - Classified MNIST dataset using MAP, MLE, Bayesian pairwise, and perpendicular bisectors to understand the fundamentals of data and classification.
    - Classified Face using six different features (Eigen Face, Fisher Face, KernelPCA, Kernel Fisher Face, VGG Face, ResNet) by training MLP classifier on Yale Face, Indian Movie Face, and IIT-CFW Database and used t-SNE for face visualization. 
    - Implemented data dimensionality reduction using PCA and ISOMAP on the CIFAR-10 dataset and classified using SVM.

- __Unsupervised Learning__  [[Code]](https://github.com/Nayanvats/)
    - Implemented Manifold learning methods - MDS, LLE, and ISOMAP. Performed k-means and spectral clustering on the Concentric Circles and Swiss roll dataset and visualized using manifold in 2-D.

##### speech processing   
* __Speech projects__ [[Code]](https://github.com/Nayanvats/) 
  - Neural style transfer of audio(spectrogram) with PyTorch based on the algorithm developed by [[Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)
  - Understanding and Implementation of wavelet Transform and Mallat S  Scattering Transform using [[Kymatio: Scattering Transforms in Python]](https://jmlr.org/papers/v21/19-047.html)
